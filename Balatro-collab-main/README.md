"Finally, Balatro is collaborating with the hit indie game Balatro"

A texture pack which swaps the hearts and spades for Joker themed variations!

Did I say jokers? I really mean the legendaries + jimbo, the secret sixth legendary

ALSO THIS IS LIKE. Baby's first mod so please be nice ;A; if there's any issue I.... might be stupid.

Install instructions:

2 - In the mods folder, create a folder called "balatro" (no speech marks)

3 - Dump files into the balatro folder

4 - Pray the game doesn't explode.
